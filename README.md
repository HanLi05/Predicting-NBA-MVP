# Predicting-NBA-MVP

## Project Description
In this project, I use NBA player stats from previous MVP winners and candidates to predict future MVP winners. 

## Technologies 
I use Beautiful Soup to scrape the web, Python and Pandas to read, clean, and wrangle datasets, matplotlib to create graphs for exploratory data analysis, and Scikit-learn to fit my cleaned data to linear regression and lasso regression models. 

## Scope
I use data on NBA MVP candidates from 2000-2022, as the game evolved significantly and the general consensus/opinion on MVP criteria changed from the 2000's forward. I analyze data on over 10,000 players and 25 different features. 

## Datasets
I collected advanced player statistics from Kaggle, and scraped basketball-reference for team records for each season, as well as MVP voting results. 

## Presentation
Here is the link to the slideshow that I created that showcased my findings.
